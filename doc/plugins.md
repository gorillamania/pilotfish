# Plugins
So you want to create your own plugin? Here's a few tips to get started, along with some best practices.

## Before you get started
#### Problem statement
What problem is this trying to solve? Try to state it as clearly as possible, from your customers perspective. Give [README driven development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html) a try, it's how pilotfish was built. :)

#### Research existing solutions
Make yourself an expert in this space. You might be the very first person on the Internets to solve this problem, but probably not, do some looking around.  Take time to see what else is out there, and pull the best pieces from each. Use it to inspire new ideas on how it should work.

Note: If after doing this research you literally find no one else who has solved this problem, I'd double check your problem statement. ;-)

#### Naming
How would you search for this? Googlability is an important part of your plugin getting adoption.
