**With your help, we can make the web more usable.** 


Would you like to contribute to pilotfish? See a typo that needs fixed? Would you like to build your own plugin? Want to fix a bug? Have you written some code that you'd like to convert to a pilotfish plugin?

You'll find a supportive group of people willing to help.

We use github's excellent forking/pull request strategy for all contributions.  It's easy.

1. [Fork this repo](https://github.com/pilotfish/pilotfish/fork_select) (you'll need a github account)
2. Make your changes, commit.
3. Issue a pull request.
4. Someone from the core team will review your changes, and merge them in.
5. Add your name to [CONTRIBUTORS](CONTRIBUTORS.md). :)
