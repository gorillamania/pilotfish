In order to guage the quality and maturity of the code inside the pilotfish community we've developed an objective rating system.

## Half a fish ![image](http://cdn.pilotfish.io/img/pilotfish-rating-0.5.png)
We all need to start somewhere, right? The developer makes no garauntees of stability, and you shouldn't be using it on a site you care about.

## One fish ![image](http://cdn.pilotfish.io/img/pilotfish-rating-1.0.png)

**Usable**

On at least 1 production site, being used by real end users. 

* Documentation via README. [Sample](https://github.com/pilotfish/pilotfish/tree/master/README.md)
* Unit tests that can be run through a browser. [Sample](https://github.com/pilotfish/pilotfish/tree/master/test)
* LICENSE [Sample](https://github.com/pilotfish/pilotfish/tree/master/LICENSE)


## Two fish ![image](http://cdn.pilotfish.io/img/pilotfish-rating-2.0.png)
**Decent**

## Three fish ![image](http://cdn.pilotfish.io/img/pilotfish-rating-3.0.png)

## Four fish ![image](http://cdn.pilotfish.io/img/pilotfish-rating-4.0.png)
**Stable**

Stable, production quality code. This plugin has been in use for at least 6 months on multiple production sites, and has encountered a wide enough variety of edge cases that it's known to be stable. This shit don't stank.

* Mechanism for the community to coordinate, handle support, and improve the plugin (mailing list)
* Separate development/beta/production code lines
* CDN hosting for the production release of the js
* Multiple contributors responsible for the project
* Code hosted on NPM
* Plugin has it's own repository
* Issue tracker

## Five fish ![image](http://cdn.pilotfish.io/img/pilotfish-rating-5.0.png)
**Enlightenment** 

Obtaining five fish is impossible for humans. If so, it would imply perfection, and we'd have to redo the scale. 4.5 is as high as you can go. :)
