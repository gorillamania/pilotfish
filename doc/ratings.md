In order to guage the quality and maturity of the code inside the pilotfish community we've developed an objective rating system.

## Half a fish ![image](http://cdn.pilotfish.io/img/pilotfish-rating-0.5.png)
We all need to start somewhere, right? This is considered alpha. You shouldn't be using it on a site you care about.

## One fish ![image](http://cdn.pilotfish.io/img/pilotfish-rating-1.0.png)

On at least 1 production site, being used by real end users. 
* Unit tests
* Documentation

## Two fish ![image](http://cdn.pilotfish.io/img/pilotfish-rating-2.0.png)
**Usable**

* Integration tests

## Three fish ![image](http://cdn.pilotfish.io/img/pilotfish-rating-3.0.png)
**Solid**

## Four fish ![image](http://cdn.pilotfish.io/img/pilotfish-rating-4.0.png)
**Stable**
Stable, production quality code. This plugin has been in use for at least 6 months on production site, and has encountered a wide enough variety of edge cases that it's known to be soliid and free of bugs.

## Five fish ![image](http://cdn.pilotfish.io/img/pilotfish-rating-5.0.png)
No plugins get five fish. If so, it would imply perfection, and we'd have to redo the scale. 4.5 is as high as you can go. :)
